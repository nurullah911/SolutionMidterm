Coffee Shop
Overview
This project simulates a Coffee Shop application, providing various functionalities such as ordering, managing coffee types, and customizing drinks. It is designed to make the process of adding new features and beverage options straightforward and maintainable.
Why a Coffee Shop?
Complex Object Setup: A coffee shop often deals with many components (e.g., different coffee variants, sizes, toppings, or customizations). Handling all of these in a single, monolithic block of code can be prone to errors.
Readability: Breaking down the ordering process—choosing the type of coffee, customizing ingredients, and handling payment—improves clarity and makes the system more manageable.
Flexibility: The architecture allows for easy addition of new coffee recipes, promotional deals, or loyalty programs without overhauling the existing codebase.
Key Features
Modular Menu System: Each coffee item can be built or customized (size, flavor shots, milk preferences, etc.).
Order Management: Users can place multiple orders, customize each drink, and receive a structured receipt.
Scalability: The design makes it easy to include new drink categories or seasonal items (e.g., holiday specials).
Customer Experience: Focus on readability and user flow, ensuring baristas and customers have a smooth ordering process.
